Tests by @Depau showed that both Elegoo‚Äôs curing (Mercury) and wash&amp;cure (Mercury Pro) machines aren‚Äôt powerful enough for it though. Other curing machines were not tested (I got the damn lamp). Cure it for a few minutes until it becomes white, stir and cure again, repeat until you see no difference after curing, then do it one last time. The residue will slowly drop to the bottom over a day and the remaining alcohol can be poured out, then filtered. The rest can be dried and disposed of.

A few example of Cartesian motion systems are: . | ‚Äúi3 style‚Äù - This is perhaps the most common enthusiast style Cartesian printer. Usually you‚Äôll see these in Prusa i3 (hence the name), Creality CR6/CR10/Ender3 lines. Basically, the bed moves on the Y, while the toolhead controls the X and Z. | ‚Äúquadrap/ultimaker style‚Äù - This is a box-style printer that often gets confused with CoreXY. A good example of these are Ultimaker printers, or the Creality Ender 5 line. These differ from i3-style printers as the bed often moves on the Z, or not at all, with the toolhead moving on X and Y. | . CoreXY (FDM) CoreXY uses a parallel manipulator system. In other words, the motors on a CoreXY system are stationary. In this case, the X and Y motors work together to move along one axis. CoreXY typically has much lower inertia, which allows for more rapid acceleration. The downside is belts are usually twice as long, and harder to tension. Delta (FDM) Delta 3D printers involve a circular print bed with a toolhead featuring three fixed triangular points. Each of these three points can move both upwards and downwards within the cylinder print structure, to be able to place the print head where it needs to be to print. ",

Klipper is a pretty unique firmware. It solves the problem of having to perform crazy optimizations to perform fast computations on slow microcontrollers by performing all the computations on a Linux machine. The 3D printer motherboard firmware is extremely simple, porting it to new hardware is very simple. The firmware is ‚Äúdumb‚Äù, it doesn‚Äôt know how to operate a printer and it is only instructed how to safely shut it down in case of failure. All movements are precomputed and sent over by its Linux companion, Klippy. Klippy is written in Python, which allows the developer to focus on functionality and stability instead of having to constantly have to work around the microcontroller limitations. Klipper in fact uses proper kinematic equations instead of optimized versions, leveraging the better floating point arithmetic support in Python. This architecture allows notoriously resource-constrained boards, such as the RAMPS to run at up to 154 steps per second. On top of that, it allows for very simple configuration, advanced movement control and advanced configuration if desired. Klipper provides the best performance on all supported boards. It also supports more exotic configurations, such as multiple main boards controlling the same printer (for example, multiple Arduino Uno-based mini-RAMPS) and multiple LCD displays. Fancy features are also supported, such as a proper ‚Äúpressure advance‚Äù algorithm, best in class ‚Äúlook ahead‚Äù support (due to in practice no RAM constraints), automatic or computer-assisted calibration for pretty much everything that needs calibration and, when paired with Trinamic drivers, it supports changing the configuration at runtime from OctoPrint, without the need to reflash the firmware. It deeply integrates with OctoPrint through a plug-in, you can both control the printer with OctoPrint and you can also control OctoPrint with the printer‚Äôs LCD. The same device that runs Klippy can also run OctoPrint. Website - RepRap Wiki - GitHub . ",

If you don‚Äôt know a lot on how to use GNU/Linux and you‚Äôre not planning to learn, this is your best option. You need at least a Raspberry Pi 2 for decent performance, and a Raspberry Pi 3 or newer if you also want to run Klipper or you want Wi-Fi. Make sure you also get a good power supply (your phone‚Äôs charger is NOT good enough) and an enclosure with cooling, since it tends to get quite hot. However, if you know how to use Linux or you think you‚Äôre able to follow the manual installation guide, get something else. A list of issues found in Raspberry Pi 2 and 3 (I haven‚Äôt received a lot of feedback on the Raspberry Pi 4 yet): . | Unless you get a very good SD card, SD cards break fast. Prefer something with different storage types if available. | The Wi-Fi/Bluetooth module found in the Raspberry Pi 3 is terrible. It randomly crashes, disconnects, drops packets, making Wi-Fi access a lot slower than the maximum supported rate. | The USB ports in both models often die after a year or two if devices are constantly connected to them. | The Ethernet in both models is not native. There is in fact a Ethernet to USB 2.0 adatper in the board. Therefore, while they claim it supports 1Gbit speeds, it can only go up to 480Mbps (most realistically ~300Mbps) | Even if you get a good power supply, you will still likely run into power issues and the power supply won‚Äôt be able to provide enough power for the whole board and the connected devices. | The SoC (the CPU, basically) on the Raspberry Pi 3 tends to get extremely hot very fast, so if you don‚Äôt provide proper cooling, it will constantly throttle at 70¬∞C. | .

You save money on the hardware, but you‚Äôre gonna spend a lot more in electricity, depending on the rates in your area. Otherwise pretty much all hardware manufactured after 2008 will easily run both OctoPrint and Klipper at the same time, even Intel Atom-based netbooks (though it might be a bit slow). I suggest you install Ubuntu Server, Debian or Fedora Server (all free and open-source Linux distrubutions) on them, then install everything else you need. Do me a favor and do not use Windows or macOS: they notoriously use a lot more power than a bare-bones Linux server OS and you‚Äôll spend even more in electricity.

Slic3r . License: open-source, GNU AGPL v3.0 . Slic3r is the father of a lot of now-more-popular knock-off slicers listed below. While it started with many experimental features, Slic3r is currently one of the most robust and stable slicers in existence. Maintainers have tough requirements to guard against regressions and bad code quality, which prompted people who want to live on the edge to maintain their fork with more experimental features. On top of being one of the most accurate slicers and (opinion mine) the slicer that produces the best bridges, Slic3r is very fast: the UI is snappy even on slow hardware and the slicing leverages multi-threading where available. It claims to support DLP/SLA, though in my experience its support is extremely basic and pretty much unusable. https://slic3r.org/ . Prusa Slicer . License: open-source, GNU AGPL v3.0 (Slic3r fork) . Even though it is developed by Prusa Research for their lineup of 3D printers, Prusa Slicer can also be used with other printer manufacturers. Prusa doesn‚Äôt list a detailed set of additional features on top of Slic3r: roughly the changes go from a UI revamp to a rewrite of all the Perl code to C++. It is quite stable and resource usage is comparable to Slic3r. It supports DLP printers (since Prusa Research also makes DLPs). However, it is not comparable with dedicated DLP slicers. https://www.prusa3d.com/prusaslicer/ . SuperSlicer . License: open-source, GNU AGPL v3.0 (Slic3r fork) . Yet another Slic3r fork, previously known as Slic3r++, SuperSlicer is a fork of Prusa Slicer, which in turn is a fork of Slic3r. SuperSlicer includes all improvements made by Prusa, plus a set of additional experimental changes. While it is not resource-intensive, it includes a lot of changes that haven‚Äôt been properly reviewed/tested. It can be thought of Slic3r but with experimental cool features. Additional changes include all Prusa Slicer changes + top surface ironing, allegedly better thin walls, overhangs and brims. In my experience it is pretty much usable, albeit having some regressions in the infill code in complex models. https://github.com/supermerill/SuperSlicer/ . Simplify3D .

    "content": "This kind of stepper driver is often researched because of the high control and current it can provide to the stepper motor, resulting in precision and torque. Extra proprietary functionality is provided by these drivers, but not all of them support all features. Here is a translation from ‚Äúsales people English‚Äù to ‚Äúnormal people English‚Äù for the most common Trinamic features: . | StealtChop: ‚ÄúQuiet mode‚Äù, the motors run extremely quietly at low-ish speeds, while still providing very good torque. | SpreadCycle: ‚ÄúNoisier mode‚Äù, the motors are noisier but they provide higher torque. Usually appropriate for higher speeds to prevent skipping steps. | StallGuard: Motor stall detection (sensorless homing). The driver can act as an endstop by pulling a pin low when a stall is detected. It needs tuning. | CoolStep: The motor current is adjusted dynamically based on feedback from the ‚ÄúStallGuard‚Äù circuitry, allowing cooler motor operation when the motor requires less torque. | MicroPlyer: Fancy name for their proprietary micro-stepping circuitry. | . Some drivers are allegedly resistant to shorts, in case you happen to work with screwdrivers nearby while your hands are shaking. The parameters for the features above can be configured using the additional UART, SPI or I¬≤C configuration protocol (depending on the driver model). For example, you can tune the speed threshold at which the driver goes from StealtChop to SpreadCycle, as well as minimum/maximum current values for each mode (CoolStep) . When used as a drop-in replacement for a Pololu driver, a TMC driver comes with a set of default thresholds that will mostly work for most printers. A trim-potentiometer is also provided like in regular steppers, and if enabled in the driver settings (it‚Äôs usually enabled out of the box), the current can be tuned with the classic ceramic screwdriver. However, when configured over UART or SPI, they offer advanced functionality. The trim-port can also be disabled in order to tune the current more precisely, programmatically. UART/SPI configuration is usually performed externally with additional hardware and software. However, some boards like the SKR 1.3 and 1.4 have the internal wiring to allow for configuration through the firmware. The STALL pin (for StallGuard/sensorless homing) is also internally connected to the respective endstop pin. This is why the board manual suggests to clip it off if you‚Äôre not planning to use the feature. TMC2130 . Maybe a little outdated, but these were the first Trinamic driver with StallGuard support. | SPI configuration | StealtChop | SpreadCycle | StallGuard / Stall detection / Sensorless homing | Phase current: 1.2A (QFN36 package), 1.4A (eTQFP48 package) | Motor supply: 4.75V to 46V | Snallest microstep: 1/256 | . TMC2208 . This driver doesn‚Äôt support StallGuard, but can support more current tham TMC2130, so more current can be given to the stepper motor, being useful in SpreadCycle mode. | UART configuration | StealtChop | SpreadCycle | StallGuard not supported | MicroPlyer | Phase current: 1.4A | Motor supply: 4.75V to 36V | Snallest microstep: 1/256 | . TMC2209 . The last generation of Trinamic drivers: supports StallGuard and SpreadCycle modes. | UART configuration | StallGuard / Stall detection / Sensorless homing | StealtChop | SpreadCycle | MicroPlyer | Phase current: 2.0A | Motor supply: 4.75V to 29V | Snallest microstep: 1/256 | .
